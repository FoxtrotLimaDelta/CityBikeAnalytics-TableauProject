# CityBikeAnalytics-TableauProject

We made an attempt to cobine csv files using Python and we were succesful at creating the correct code. There was, however, issues with the data itself and time constraints pushed us to move on to creating the visualizations and report without combining the csv files.

Using Tableau we created 8 visualizations, 3 story boards, and 2 dashboards visualizing the summer of 2019 bike data. We found some interesting trends and are attaching a report of our findings and suggested next possible steps.
